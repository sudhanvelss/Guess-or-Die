        <b>In a peaceful village, there was an honest merchant who was falsely accused for a crime. Lawyers tried their best to help him, but it was tough as there wasn't any proof to prove that he was innocent. To test the merchant the judge had given him some puzzles and quizzes to solve. If he had answered them all correctly in few tries, he is let to go free. But if he makes many mistakes, he'd face a dire consequence: (i.e: “The risk of a Capital Punishment.”)</b>
